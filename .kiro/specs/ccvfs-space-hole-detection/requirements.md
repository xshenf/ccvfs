# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an effective space hole detection and allocation system for the CCVFS (Compressed Column Virtual File System). Currently, the system always allocates space at the end of the file, which leads to inefficient space usage when pages are deleted or updated. This enhancement will implement a best-fit algorithm to find and reuse available space holes, improving storage efficiency and reducing file size growth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database system using CCVFS, I want freed space to be efficiently reused, so that the database file size remains optimal and doesn't grow unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is deleted or updated THEN the system SHALL track the freed space as an available hole
2. WHEN allocating space for a new page THEN the system SHALL first search for suitable holes before allocating at file end
3. WHEN multiple holes are available THEN the system SHALL use a best-fit algorithm to minimize fragmentation
4. WHEN no suitable hole is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to end-of-file allocation
5. WHEN a hole is partially used THEN the system SHALL update the hole record with remaining space

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CCVFS developer, I want the hole detection system to be memory efficient, so that it doesn't consume excessive RAM for large databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking holes THEN the system SHALL use a compact data structure to minimize memory overhead
2. WHEN the number of holes exceeds a threshold THEN the system SHALL merge adjacent holes automatically
3. WHEN holes become too small to be useful THEN the system SHALL remove them from tracking
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL rebuild hole information from existing file structure if needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the hole detection to be configurable, so that I can optimize for different usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL allow enabling/disabling hole detection
2. WHEN hole detection is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to end-of-file allocation
3. WHEN configuring minimum hole size THEN the system SHALL only track holes above the specified threshold
4. WHEN configuring maximum holes to track THEN the system SHALL limit memory usage accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CCVFS user, I want the hole detection to maintain data integrity, so that no data corruption occurs during space reuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reusing a hole THEN the system SHALL verify the space is actually free before allocation
2. WHEN writing to a reused hole THEN the system SHALL ensure complete data integrity
3. WHEN a hole allocation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to end-of-file allocation gracefully
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log hole allocation decisions for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious application, I want hole detection to have minimal performance impact, so that database operations remain fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for holes THEN the operation SHALL complete in O(log n) time or better
2. WHEN no suitable holes exist THEN the search SHALL terminate quickly
3. WHEN updating hole information THEN the operation SHALL be atomic and fast
4. WHEN the system is under heavy load THEN hole detection SHALL not become a bottleneck
